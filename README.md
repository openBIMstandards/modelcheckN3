#Introduction
Creating a new graph with input from ifcOWL triples + additional queries. 
Doing this with EYE (Euler reasoner). This results in a simplified graph that is usable for ‘simple’ N3 queries. 
Main goal is to lower the threshold for domain experts to use the power of Semantic Web for validating/checking of IFC models.

#Requirements
We use EYE Euler reasoner to develop and test this. Find it on http://eulersharp.sourceforge.net/ 
Also very nice to get started is this link: http://n3.restdesc.org/
